Team 3: Weather App Project
=======================

####Synopsis
This is a weather-viewing program that allows users to view the current weather in their current location. Furthermore, it allows users to enter a city to view their weather or even the weather on Mars! 

This program was developed using Java programming language. The program retrieves the data from [openweathermap's](http://openweathermap.org/api) API and [marsweather.ingenology.com](http://marsweather.ingenology.com) for weather on Mars. Further more we used the following external libraries:
* [commons-io](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccommons-io)
* [json-simple](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cjson-simple)

####Install
Inside the "JAR file" folder download the "WeatherAppTeam3.jar" file and double click! That's it! The program will run immediately.

####Build
To package then run the App, from this directory, use the commands:

	mvn package
	java -jar target/WeatherApp-1.2-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
